                    <li>50 g fresh yeast</li>
                    <li>500 ml milk</li>
                    <li>350 g sugar</li>
                    <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
                    <li>100 g butter at room temperature</li>
                    <li>5 egg yolks</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>zest from one lemon and one orange</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>For the filling</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>400 g finely chopped walnuts</li>
                    <li>5 egg whites</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons cocoa</li>
                    <li>raisins</li>
                    <li>turkish delight</li>
                    <li>an extra egg and a bit of milk for brushing</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour 3 times. This is an important step, so don’t skip it.</li>
            <li>Warm the milk along with the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds, adding the entire vanilla bean to the milk as well. The milk should just be warm when you try it with your finger, not hot!</li>
            <li>Use a fork to dissolve the fresh yeast with 3-4 tablespoons of the warm milk.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, where you previously put the flour, make a whole in the center and add the yeast mixture. Sprinkle a bit of flour on top and leave it like that for 10 to 15 minutes, until the yeast makes bubbles.</li>
            <li>Mix the egg yolks with the lemon zest, orange zest and salt.</li>
            <li>Put the egg yolk mixture in the bowl with the flour, but not directly over the yeast. The salt in the mixture can kill the yeast.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla-flavored milk and start mixing with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Mix the butter and oil in a separate, small bowl.</li>
            <li>When all the ingredients are well-combined, start kneading the dough, while continuously dipping your hands in the butter and oil mixture and gradually adding it to the dough. You have to knead for at least half an hour.</li>
            <li>After half an hour, cover the bowl with cling film and leave it in a warm place to rise, for 1 ½ hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the filling. Beat the egg whites with the sugar and add the finely chopped walnuts and the cocoa.</li>
            <li>After the dough has risen, split it into 4 equal balls.</li>
            <li>Take each ball and spread it with your hands in a rectangular form on an oiled working surface.</li>
            <li>Spread ¼ of the mixture over each rolled dough ball, then spread some raisins and Turkish delight bits, and then roll it up.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the three remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Now, put two rolls over each other in an X form, order phentermine 37.5 mg online, and start braiding from the middle toward the ends.</li>
            <li>Place the sweet breads in two buttered loaf pans topped with baking paper. Leave them to rise until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°</li>
            <li>Place the loaves in the oven and bake for 40-50 minutes. Make sure you don’t open the oven during the first 20 minutes. After this time, you can cover them anytime with aluminium foil, so they don’t become too brown. Check if they’re done by inserting a toothpick into the center – if it comes out clean, the sweet breads are ready. It took 50 minutes for mine to be ready, but it depends on your oven.</li>
            <li>When the sweet breads are ready, let them cool completely in their loaf pans, then cut them into slices and serve.</li>
        </ol>
