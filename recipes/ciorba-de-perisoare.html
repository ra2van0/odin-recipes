        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Romanian we call these types of soups “ciorba”.  “Ciorba” in Romanian usually refers to sour soups with vegetables and some form of meat.  They are made sour by adding either lemon juice, “bors” which is fermented wheat bran, sauerkraut juice, or sometimes even vinegar. “Ciorba de perisoare” basically means meatball soup.</p>
        <p>When it comes to this soup  I just use lemon juice and this gives the soup a very nice sour taste. The meatballs are quite simple and although I used pork in these recipe, any type of ground meat will work. I’ve made them with ground beef, ground beef, or even ground chicken or turkey, you could even mix the meats.</p>

                <b>For the soup</b>

                        <li>Olive oil</li>
                        <li>Veggies - carrots, onions and celery</li>
                        <li>Tomato paste</li>
                        <li>Liquids - lemon juice, chicken broth and water</li>
                        <li>Vegeta</li>
                        <li>Lovage</li>
                        <li>1 beaten egg</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the meatball mixture
                <p>To begin, add the ground pork along with all the other meatball ingredients to a large bowl. Then use your hands or a wooden spoon to combine everything together well. I find that my hands do the most efficient job. And don’t be afraid to really get into it as the ingredients need to be evenly distributed for the best results. </p>
                <p>Yet, once everything is mixed together, if you notice that the mixture is not binding it could mean that the mixture is either too wet or too dry. If the meatballs are too wet just add a little more of the breadcrumbs and if they are too dry add a little more egg. However, don’t just toss in another whole egg. You need to whisk an egg in a small bowl and then add a little at a time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Form the meatballs
                <p>Now, form the meat mixture into about 30 to 35 meatballs that are each 1 inch in diameter. They don’t need to be perfect, yet they all do need to be about the same size so that they cook evenly. Then place the raw meatballs in the fridge until you are ready to add them to the soup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Make the base
                <p>Next, let’s start the soup! Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large 5-quart heavy bottom pot. Then add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook for about 5 minutes or until the onions are soft and translucent. Now, add a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Then stir in the tomato paste followed by the chicken broth and water.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the soup
                <p>Bring the soup to a boil and add the meatballs one at a time. Once the meatballs have been added, cook them for about 10 minutes or until they float to the top, which means that they are done. Then season with vegeta and add the lemon juice and lovage. Now, taste the soup and season with salt and pepper as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Finish the meatball soup
                <p>To complete the recipe, you need to add the egg. Very slowly pour the egg into the soup in a steady steam. Next, stir the egg quickly in a clockwise direction for about one minute to make shreds. Then let the soup cook for one last minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Garnish and serve
                <p>The recipe is complete! Ladle the soup into your favorite bowls and garnish it with some fresh parsley. Then serve it immediately with some sour cream and enjoy!</p>
